# Introduction
Chaffinches (*Fringilla coelebs*) are one of the most wide spread and abundant birds in Britian [@noauthor_undated-dq]. The average weight of the chaffinch is around 24g [@noauthor_undated-js] but it is unstated whether there is a difference between male and female averages. Since male and female chaffinches have such widely varying colour and plumage (see Figure \@ref(fig:chaff-fig)) it is reasonable to assume they would differ in mass too. That's what our analysis hopes to uncover.

# Methods

```{r import data}
# the working directory is in the scripts folder
# had to use backwards relative path to get to data
chaff_raw <- read.table("../data_raw/chaff.txt", header = T)
```

```{r tidy data}
chaff_tidy <- pivot_longer(data = chaff_raw,
                           cols = everything(),
                           names_to = "sex",
                           values_to = "mass")
```

```{r create sumsq function, include=FALSE}
# the double braces are used to indicate a column of a dataframe
sum_sq <- function(df, measure, group) {
  df %>% group_by({{ group }}) %>% 
    summarise(ss = sum(({{measure}} - mean({{measure}}))^2))
}

sum_sq(chaff_tidy, mass, sex)
```

```{r summary}
chaff_sum <- chaff_tidy %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(mass),
            std = sd(mass),
            n = length(mass),
            se = std/sqrt(n))
```

We measured the mass of `r chaff_sum$n[1]` chaffinches for both sexes and used R [@R] along with the tidyverse package [@tidy] to analyse the results to see if there is a significant difference between the mass of the sexes.

# Results

```{r summary-function}
# create function that summarizes data and includes
# mean, sd, smaple size, se
data_summary <- function(df, measure, group){
 df %>% group_by({{group}}) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean({{measure}}),
            n = length({{measure}}),
            sd = sd({{measure}}),
             se = sd/sqrt(n))
}

data_summary(chaff_tidy, mass, sex)
```
